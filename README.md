experiment
==========

A small C++ project intended to get me up to speed with that language once more

Some of the more salient aspects of this project include:

* Usage of Google Test
* Usage of Google Mocks
* CMake
* Management of test/library/executable with CMake structure

Over time I may expand this to also involve lessons learned from Thrift RPC and a couple of other technologies I have a budding interest in.
